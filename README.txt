## Expression Tokenizer and Parser

1. Additional Token Types:
   - Pipe (|): For filter chaining
   - Parentheses ( ): For grouping expressions
   - Comma (,): For constructing arrays or objects
   - Equals (=): For variable assignment
   - Semicolon (;): For separating expressions
   - Question mark (?): For optional object identifier
   - Star (*): For recursive descent
   - At symbol (@): For object construction
   - Dollar sign ($): For variable references

2. Extended Identifier Parsing:
   - Allow for quoted identifiers: "foo bar"
   - Support for special identifiers like null, true, false

3. String Literal Parsing:
   - Support for both single and double-quoted strings
   - Handle escape sequences within strings

4. Number Parsing:
   - Support for both integer and floating-point numbers
   - Handle scientific notation

5. Array Construction:
   - Parse array constructions like [1, 2, 3]

6. Object Construction:
   - Parse object constructions like {a: 1, b: 2}

7. Function Calls:
   - Recognize function calls with parentheses

8. Operators:
   - Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
   - Comparison: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
   - Logical: and, or, not

9. Special Syntax:
   - Slicing syntax: [start:end]
   - Iterate operator: []

10. Comments:
    - Support for single-line (#) and multi-line comments

11. Variable Binding:
    - Parse variable assignments and references

Implementation Suggestions:
- Use a more sophisticated tokenizer, possibly using a state machine
- Implement a recursive descent parser for handling nested structures
- Consider using operator precedence parsing for mathematical expressions
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- Add support for multi-character operators (e.g., '==', '!=', '<=', '>=')
